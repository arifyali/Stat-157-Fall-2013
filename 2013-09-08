Reflections for the week of September 8th
===========================================================================================================================

1) This week resulted in the exposure to new software such as the OS Ubuntu, which I'm catagorizing as software, as well as
iPython and the subsequent notebook attachment within the browser. It was extremely un-nerving because my experience in python
is extremely limited as was using Ubuntu via Virtual Box. Combining, Virtual Box and ipython has never been attempted by me.
