Reflections for the week of September 8th
===========================================================================================================================

1) This week resulted in the exposure to new software such as the OS Ubuntu, which I'm catagorizing as software, as well as
iPython and the subsequent notebook attachment within the browser. It was extremely un-nerving because my experience in python
is extremely limited as was using Ubuntu via Virtual Box. Combining, Virtual Box and ipython has never been attempted by me. 
Initiatly, I was no sure that Ubuntu was functioning properly because didn't know that I was running the server and not the 
desktop. With the help of fellow student Yuqi Tao, I was able to see that my "mistake" was not a mistake.

2) I am not sure if there was any more pressing "aha" momment this week then realizing the value of the Ubuntu server. Thanks
to the instructor, Aaron Culich, I learned that the server was in fact better than the terminal that I'm running on my Mac, and
I deduced that it might be possible to write R scripts and run them in the Back End on the internet.

3) I wished that I had beeen able to explore ipython more in depth. I also wished that instead of immediately asking for help
that I would have smartly re-read the instructions and done more deep research of the topic.
