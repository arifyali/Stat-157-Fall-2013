November 23th's week of reflections
===================================

This week we adjusted to a major restructing within our group. 

Helped with discovering a workaround regarding X11. The main issue was the inability to run the script directly from Terminal
but we realized that X11 has a command prompt and could be run that way.

(Update 11/24)
We have managed to meet as a group and discuss our various functions as well as possible adjustments that we can make. One 
of the biggest concerns was the idea that finish everything by this week, which we all decided would be impossible and should
be highlighted ASAP.
