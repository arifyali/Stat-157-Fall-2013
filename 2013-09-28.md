Reflections for the week of September 28th
=============================================
I will say that this week, it was nice to actually understand that many of the same frustrations that I have been having were not 
just isolated. A classmate did make a point that I agree, we have setup all this software, which while important, we haven't
gotten to experience their uses. While I understand that all the tools are important to a common goal, I would like it if we
could at least put some of the new software into practice. I did like that one of my ideas, the google calendar, will actually
be implemented, furthering the idea of collaborative science.
If I could start this week all over again, I would have voiced my concerns. I do like that there is an open door policy, where
concerns can be voiced and that we can sugest some deltas.
