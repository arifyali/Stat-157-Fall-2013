Reflections
===========

This week saw the cummulation of the knowledge that we've been practicing for the last few weeks. We (Our Group) was finally
able to show our work to other groups in the class and we were able to show the capabilities of all the processes that we
have been working towards. It was nice to realize that many of the problems our vertical group has with respect to assigning
certain tasks were common throughout the groups. 

If I could have started this week all over again, I would have requested that we be given until Wednesday night to finish 
our assignment. I had a brutal midterm and it was extremely hard to balance the time. Thankfully the moto of reproducibility
rather than perfection helped. I spent my time making sure the process worked rather than how "clean" the code should in theory
be.
