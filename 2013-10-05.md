Week of October 5th
===================
This week we finally got into using our skills that we have been developing for the last 7 weeks. It highlighted many issues
that I didn't know with the new techniques.

The cool part was the collaboration techniques that we used. It was cool that we were capable of doing virtual meeting since
members were not in town

If I could start this week over again, i Would have started the project the minute class was over on tuesday because
of all the commitments I currently have. I'm a more visual learner so it would have been great to see some python demos
instead of having the GSI help me on every little part.
