Reflection for the week of 11/16-written 11/17
===============================================

<p>First off, I am 24 hours late with this because I was meeting up with my group to get a better understanding of what we
are doing. So, we adjusted our SMART goals accordingly. This also involved breaking up our original groups to focus on different
aspects. We will still have representatives in the visualizer and analyzer groups, but most of our task is essentially the same.</p>
<p>As curators, we will start performing code review on other groups codes. This any came about after members from analyzer 
group A request that we help make their code flexible to further reproduciblity. We figuring since the majority (if not all)
of the caching and cleaning have been completeed, this should be
the next step.</p>
