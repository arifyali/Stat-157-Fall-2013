Reflection for the week of 11/16-written 11/17
===============================================

<p>First off, I am 24 hours late with this because I was meeting up with my group to get a better understanding of what we
are doing. So, we adjusted our SMART goals accordingly. This also involved breaking up our original groups to focus on different
aspects. We will still have representatives in the visualizer and analyzer groups, but most of our task is essentially the same.</p>
<p>As curators, we will start performing code review on other groups codes. This any came about after members from analyzer 
group A request that we help make their code flexible to further reproduciblity. We figure, since the majority (if not all)
of the caching and cleaning have been completeed, this should bethe next step.</p> 
<p> The second step to look into should the streamling of all Code (R and python) into one simple file that can be called just
once. Initially, we were going in the direction of converting everything into iPython, but that would be difficult due to
custom R packages that other groups have used. After learning that we can Call R within the iPython Notebook, we decided that
the challenge would be identifying inputs and outputs and just ensuring information will be passed on correctly.</P>
<p> Part of the challenge of this is is we need code at certain times, thus making us control deadlines of coding for other
groups, but this is ok because we were considered "administrators" to begin with. </p>
<p> This task reminds me of what Chris say, 90% is creating the project, and 10% is maintaining. We have completed the creation
and me are now on maintainance mode.</p>
