Redlections for the Week of 9/21

This week was the introduction of the collabative theory of data science. I didn't really understand the need of certain 
aspects regarding the topic, but it was a nice experience to suggest the use of certain R packages that could be benefical
to the speaker this week. Also, there was a bit of struggle remember basic Statistics concepts during Thursday; however, a 
fellow classmate, Carl Shan selflessly emailed resources to help "jog" our memmory.

I managed to finally get up to speed with all the software we have used so far thanks to the special hours held by the GSIs
this Friday. IPython finally works! Chris helped me by looking at the Vagrant file, which helped route the connection.

The thing I would have done differently involves just starting early on everything. I started this reflection pretty late, 
I was late at submitting the last reflection, and was kinda late to the special hours.
