Reflections for the Week of Saturday 26th.
==========================================

With the help of Aaron, I managed to figure out how to create a spreadsheet and populate it via the iPython notebook.
While Aaron was able to help in the initial creation of the notebook, I was able to populate via a for loop.
Initially I had to use one forloop for each category in the Earthquake data, but I have recently figured out a way to
simplify that process. 

Our code was reproducible which was determined on Tuesday. Due to an Eye infection, I have to sit out of Thursday Lecture
and am currently getting information on the project. Currently, I know the new policy regarding grading, so I can keep on
top of that, but am still waiting to get hard notes, which Jody Zhang will be able to provide me with. I will update the 
reflection with more information as it becomes availiable.
