Reflections for the week of November 30th
=========
This week, we discussed the progress of other groups to get a better idea of the codes that are finished and ready to test. I'm currently cloning finished group's repos and also attempting the tests. Currently, I'm on vacation so internet access has been spotty, but I will try attempting codes that require no access first. I am happy to see that groups that are finished are posting links on our issue tracker!
