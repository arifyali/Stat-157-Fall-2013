Reflections for the week of September 14th
Setting up IPython proved to immensely difficult however I managed with the help of the GSIs to finished setting up a decent amount.
Vagrant setting up nicely with the terminal in Mac although I am still unsure of what to actually do with it. It was hard, not having a roadmap, to see 
the value and involves having much trust in the team involved. It has worked to replicate the processes that I have gone through by helping others.

The Team building exercises proved to be an AHA momment when you realize that you incompentence can affect the entire group.
We did have to attempt to get everyone of the same page which proved to be very stressful, but actually served to benefit everyone.

The things I would have done differently would have to work on a better communication strategy. This next week, the plan is to be able to actually implement an independent IRC channel for the group.
I think levels of communication are important and that other groups should set up independent systems.
