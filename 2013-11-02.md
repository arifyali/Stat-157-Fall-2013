Reflection for the week of November 2nd 2013
============================================

  18 days before my birthday, I figured out how Stack Over Flow works, specificially the amount of information that can be
obtained by asking people that are very experienced at that sort of thing. When trying to find a built in list of the alphabet
I was able to get an answer within 10 minutes as well as some comments on how to post in the future. In addition, I managed
to gain a little bit of reputation on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19747199/is-there-a-built-in-list-in-python-or-some-package-that-has-a-list-of-the-alphab/19747239?noredirect=1#19747239). It also lead me to another [stack exchange](http://stackexchange.com/), [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/), which 
I think will actually be useful when attempting other stat classes.

  This week lead to the formation of new groups regarding the current project. I like the idea of being mainly involved with
our horizontal group; whereas before, we tended to be strictly working within vertical groups. The major accomplishment of
the horizontal group was the design of our approach to our task. The major categories that were determined was the cleaning
and caching. 

  I suggested that for caching and for formating to analyzers, we should implement Google Spreadsheet. This was done after
we realized that the CSV would be too large to push to github an would be inaccessible unless we had a "sneaker-net" workaround.
Since that was not possible, the Spreadsheet seemed like a logical choice. Current limitations to this is that a for loop
has to be implimented and there are almost 600,000 entries to worry about so that process must be changed.

  I really wished that I could have learned more regarding Stack overflow because it would have had saved me a couple of hours.
I believe that these stack excahnges will be very helpful when we go further into the Earthquake project.
